"""End-to-end smoke test of the qatf HTTP API.

    python tests/smoke_api.py [scratch-dir]

ffmpeg, faster-whisper and the Anthropic call are faked at the lowest possible
level (`pipeline.audio.run`, `pipeline.encode.run`, `pipeline.asr.transcribe`,
`pipeline.select.pick_clips`) so everything above them — the job state machine,
the transcript cache, snap, build_ass, filtergraph, the plan round trip and every
endpoint — runs for real. Needs no ffmpeg, no GPU and no API key; it therefore
proves nothing about those four functions themselves.

Settings are injected directly rather than through os.environ, which is the
point of `create_app(settings=...)`.

Exits non-zero on any failure.
