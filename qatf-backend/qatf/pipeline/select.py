"""Stage 3 — the model proposes clips.

The ONLY thing the model is asked for is *which passages*, at MM:SS resolution.
It is never asked for precise timing, because it has no way to know it and will
confabulate sub-second values. Stage 4 fixes the boundaries.

Executed against a real endpoint: OpenRouter, at the `json_object` tier, on real
Arabic material. Every other provider in the roster is still documentation-only —
`smoke_llm.py` pins what we *send* them, and none of those endpoints has ever
replied. See "Verification status" in CLAUDE.md before claiming otherwise.

- opens on a hook: a claim, a question, a number, a contradiction, a story opening
- resolves. It does not stop mid-argument

    the model from inventing precise timings it can't actually know.

    Each line is labelled with the SPAN it covers, `[MM:SS-MM:SS]`, not just
    where it starts. That one change was worth more than three model sizes.

    Measured on the same Arabic transcript at `--clips 8 --min-len 30
    --max-len 52`: start labels alone gave `qwen3-235b` 2 clips in range, six of
    the eight clustered at ~24s; span labels gave 8 of 8 at 36-50s. Scaling the
    model 8B -> 14B -> 235B had moved that number by exactly one.

    The models were never doing bad arithmetic. With only start labels the sole
    timestamps in the prompt are block STARTS, so copying two of them is the one
    span the format affords — 2 x 12.2s = 24.4s falls out of the shape of the
    prompt, not out of any judgment about how long a clip should be. Give the
    line an end and the durations move. Numbers in `docs/quality.md`.

    A block's end is the next block's start, and the last block ends at the last
    word's end. Contiguous by construction: a gap would invite a boundary inside
    it, which is a timestamp nothing can snap to.

    This does NOT weaken the core invariant. The model still answers in `MM:SS`
    and stage 4 still snaps every boundary onto a real word. It gets a better
    VIEW of the transcript, not more authority over timing."""
