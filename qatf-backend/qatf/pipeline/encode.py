"""Stage 5b — reframe to 9:16, burn captions, encode.

All three filtergraphs are verified to produce 1080x1920 with correct duration.
`crop` and `blur` are static; `track` takes a solved crop path from stage 4c and
drives it with `sendcmd`. See "Tracking frames a face, not a speaker" in
CLAUDE.md for what that does and does not do.

Performance, measured (4 clips at 1080x1920, captions burned in, 16 cores):
the encoder is the only thing worth tuning here. The filter chain is noise —
the `ass` filter is 2.1% of a render, `flags=lanczos` costs nothing over
bicubic, `+faststart` is free — and running clips concurrently returns only
1.21x, because the encoder already saturates the machine. See `PRESETS`.
