"""Stage 5a — ASS subtitle generation.

Every constant here was paid for by rendering a frame and looking at it. Read
the gotchas in CLAUDE.md before changing any of them, and re-verify visually —
ffprobe reporting correct dimensions is not sufficient.

VERIFIED, AND IT BREAKS ON RTL: libass starts a new bidi run wherever an
override tag causes an actual style change. Per-word highlighting therefore
chops an RTL line into independently-reordered runs, and the visual word order
comes out scrambled — measured by walking the highlight along a line and
watching its horizontal centre move LEFT to RIGHT on Arabic and Hebrew, when RTL
must move right to left. Neither Unicode bidi controls (RLE/PDF, RLM, FSI/PDI)
nor `\\k` karaoke avoid the split.

So `build_ass` does not highlight per word on RTL text. It emits one cue per
caption line instead, which lays out correctly because nothing splits the run.
LTR is unaffected and keeps word-by-word highlighting.
