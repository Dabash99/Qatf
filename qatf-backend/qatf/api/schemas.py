"""Request/response models for the HTTP API.

These are the wire contract only. Pipeline types live in `qatf.core.types` and
are deliberately kept as plain dataclasses so the CLI has no pydantic dependency.

`JobState` is re-exported from `qatf.jobs.model` rather than defined here: the
job lifecycle is a domain concept and `jobs` must never import from `api`. It
serialises correctly in responses because it is already a `str` Enum.

Every model carries a worked example. Those examples are the OpenAPI schema —
Swagger UI prefills "Try it out" from them, and client generators emit them as
fixtures — so they must stay *runnable*, not illustrative. A field description
that reads like documentation is doing its job twice: once in `/docs`, once in
the generated client's docstring.
