    Reports `degraded` when ffmpeg is missing or the stage-3 provider has no
    usable credential. Both are worth knowing up front rather than three minutes
    into a job — a missing API key otherwise surfaces only *after* transcription
    has already run.

    Two fields answer the question benchmarks get wrong:

    * `cuda_devices` — how many devices **CTranslate2** can actually target. Not
      what `nvidia-smi` reports: a card the installed CTranslate2 cannot use
      (compute capability, driver mismatch) is not a usable device, and only the
      engine knows that.
    * `transcribe_device` — what stage 2 will pick under `device: auto`. If this
      says `cpu` on a machine with a GPU, a `large-v3` run is about to take a
      very long time.
    * `caption_pill_ready` — whether the `youtube` pill caption style can
      actually render on THIS host. False means uharfbuzz is not installed or
      fontconfig cannot resolve the default font, and every job that asks for
      the pill style will silently fall back to `pop` — see
      `captions.resolve_style`. Worth knowing before submitting a job rather
      than reading it off the rendered clips afterwards.

    `providers` carries the whole stage-3 roster with each entry's structured-
    output tier, so a client can offer a provider picker without hardcoding one.
