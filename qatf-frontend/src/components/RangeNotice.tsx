 *
 * Every clip listed here IS in the plan and WILL be rendered. This used to be
 * a list of clips the server had thrown away for missing the range, and the
 * throwing away is what turned out to be wrong: on the run that settled it,
 * six of eight picks were 24-second shorts against a min_len of 30 — publishable
 * clips, deleted unseen for missing a number by four seconds.
 *
 * So the notice reports rather than apologises. It exists so a short clip is
 * something the operator chose to keep, not something they discover on upload. */
